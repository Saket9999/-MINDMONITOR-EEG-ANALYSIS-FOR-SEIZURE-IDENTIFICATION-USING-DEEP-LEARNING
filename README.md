This study addresses epilepsy, a disorder affecting 1% of the global population, by analyzing brain signal datasets to categorize epileptic and non-epileptic signals. Five filters, including Gaussian and Butterworth, were applied, with Butterworth achieving the best Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Deep learning models, such as RNN, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet, were used for classification, with GoogLeNet achieving 98.60% accuracy. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) was also utilized to prevent catastrophic forgetting in model training.
